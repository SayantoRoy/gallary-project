<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]]

There are many projects and websites where one can upload their art/image/pic and share with the world but this project is one that I wanted to create for the artists whose main focus was to share the art project they are working on, with just very specific group of people.
 
Here's why:
* While working as a freelancer, I had difficulty finding a simple place to share the whole project without much thinking about the client's technical knowledge about some platform.
* This project was built specifically with that in mind. I can share the whole gallery or just a few images that I want to share with shareable links.
* The minimalist theme along with the features is done so that one doesn't need much time to get used to it and start working wihtin seconds.

Gallart was one of those projects through which one can make and share their arts or where one can just upload their pics for those special friends to see.
